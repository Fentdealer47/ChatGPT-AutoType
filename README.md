This project is for educational purposes only. I do not take liability for any misuse.

## How To Use

### Prerequisites:
1. Install Python 3.7 or later.  
2. Install the required libraries using pip:  
   ```bash
   pip install openai pynput
   ```
If for any reason it says you need an earlier version of OpenAI please follow the instructions.
### Setup:

Get your OpenAI API key from OpenAI.
Replace the placeholder YOUR_API_KEY_HERE in the script with your actual API key.

### Running the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script with:
```bash
python your_script_name.py
```
After entering your query in the terminal, switch to the window where you want the text to be typed (e.g., a Google Doc).
Watch as the script simulates typing the response, complete with pauses and corrections!
### Features:
Simulated Typing: The script types text character by character, mimicking human behavior.

Random Pauses: Occasionally pauses for a few seconds to feel more natural.

Typing Mistakes: Introduces random typos, then "fixes" them with backspaces.

Customizable Timing: You can adjust the typing speed, pause frequency, and typo rate.

Notes:

Ensure the target application (like Google Docs) is the active window when typing begins.
